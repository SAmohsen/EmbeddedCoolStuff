<b> Doing Some Cool Stuff With AVR</b>
<br>

<h2>Projects</h2>


<h4>DoorLock</h4>
<p>Consists of two ECUâ€™s. The first ECU called HMI responsible for interfacing with the user and the
second ECU called control ECU which is responsible for the system operations and control.
(AVR ,UART,i2c ,LCD, KeyPad,DC motors,SSD , ExternalEEprom).</p>

<h4>Smart Clock</h4>
<p>
	Digital Clock that Displays Alarm, Date , Time and temperature (AVR ,Timers , Lm35 ,LCD)
</p>

<h4>Square Wave Generator</h4>
<p>
	Generating A Square Wave Signal With Desired Frequency (AVR ,Timers, LCD)
</p>
<h4>DC Motor Speed Controller.</h4>
<p>Controlling DC Motor Speed and Direction of Rotation(AVR,PWM,ADC ,DC Motor,POT,LCD)</p>

<h4>MicroWave Oven FirmWare</h4>
<p>creating a firmware to control Microwave </p>
<h2>Utils</h2>
<h4>ADC Auto Triggering Mode</h4>
<p>triggering conversion automatically by various sources.</p>

<h4>Multplexing Multiple Seven Segments</h4>
<p> muxing more than one SSD, we display only one SSD at a time, and we switch between them so fast to  face the lack of I/O pins .</p>

<h4>UART HandShaking</h4>
<p>controling Data for communicating between a DCE and a DTE to prevent data loss during transmission.</p>

<h4>signal Measurements Using ICU</h4>
<p>using (ICU) for demodulation of a PWM signal, counting pulses, measuring of frequency and duty cycle</p>
